Next, create a new site.

Pick **GitHub** as your provider.

Then pick your project from the list.

It'll default the branch to `master`. And since we are configuring our project through the `netlify.toml`, we can leave the rest as is. Hit **Deploy site**.

This should be deploying our app. Once, it is done click on the deployment.

And hit **Preview deploy**.

Of course, it is hosted on a Netlify URL. We'll change that by configuring custom domains next.
