With AWS Organizations, you can create and manage all the AWS accounts in your root account.

# Create AWS accounts

Go to AWS Organizations console

The account labeled with the star is your **root** AWS account. This account cannot be removed from the organization.

Select **Add account**

You can either create a new AWS account or if you already have multiple standalone AWS accounts, you can add them into your organization.

Select **Create account**

Let's create our Production account first. Fill out:

- **Full name**: enter Prod, Production or what you would like to call this account. It is used for display purpose only.
- **Email**: each account requires a unique email address. Emails with '+' sign are allowed.
- **IAM role name**: Leave it empty. When creating a new account, AWS Organizations automatically creates an IAM role in the new account that allows the root account to be able to assume into it. Actually, that is the only way to access a newly created account. By default, the IAM role is named **OrganizationAccountAccessRole**, you can give it another name.

Now, you have 2 AWS accounts in your organization.

# Access AWS accounts

Next, let's try switch into the Production account via the console. First, take a note of the newly created **Account ID**. We need this number in the next step.

Then, Select the account picker at the top.

Select **Switch Role**

[](/assets/best-practices/create-and-manage-aws-accounts-using-aws-organizations-7.png)

Fill in:

- **Account**: Account ID of the newly created Prod account from the previous step
- **Role**: Name of the IAM role from the previous step. If you left it blank, put in **OrganizationAccountAccessRole**
- **Display Name:** It is good to use the First Name from the previous step to keep account names recognizable.
- **Color**: Pick a color you think means **Production** to you :)

Note, the Display Name and Color fields are personal to you. Your team members will need to set this up again.

Then select **Switch Role**

Now, you are in the **Prod** account. You can check which account you are currently assumed into by looking at the top bar.

You can switch back to the root account by click on the account picker and select **Back to root**
