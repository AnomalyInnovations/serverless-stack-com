When deploying multiple environments, some into the same AWS account, some across multiple AWS accounts, we need to ensure the resource names do not thrash across environments. For example, in our `checkout-api` service, we have a Lambda function called `checkout`. Now, if two developers are working on two different features, one deployed to the `featureA` environment and one deploys to the `featureB` environment, and both environments reside in the `Dev` AWS account, only one environment can be successfully deployed. The second environment will get an error indicating that a Lambda function with the name `checkout` already exists.

AWS resources need to be uniquely named within a scope, and the scope is different for different resource types. Here are the rules for commonly used serverless resources:

- Unique per account per region: Lambda functions, API Gateway projects, SNS Topic, etc.
- Unique per account (across all regions): IAM users/roles
- Unique globally: S3 buckets

The best practice to ensure uniqueness is by parameterizing resource names with the name of the stage. In our example, we can name the Lambda function `checkout-featureA` for the `featureA` stage; `checkout-featureB` for the `featureB` stage; and `checkout-dev` for the `dev` stage.

Luckily, Serverless Framework already parameterizes a few of the default resources:

| Resource | Scheme | Example |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Lambda functions | `$serviceName-$stage-$functionName` | post-service-dev-create-post |
| API Gateway project | `$stage-$serviceName` | dev-post-service |
| CloudWatch log groups | `/aws/lambda/$serviceName-$stage-$functionName` | /aws/lambda/post-service-dev-create-post |
| IAM roles | `$serviceName-$stage-$region-lambdaRole` | post-service-dev-us-east-1-lambdaRole |
| S3 bucket | `$stackName-serverlessdeploymentbucket-$hash` | post-service-dev-serverlessdeploymentbucket-3cux6eq6iadj |

A couple of things to note here:

- Resource names are parameterize with `$serviceName` to ensure resource names do not thrash when deploying multiple services
- The IAM role is the one used by the Lambda functions. IAM role names are also parameterized with `$region` since the name needs to be unique across regions in an account.
- S3 bucket is the one used by Serverless Framework to store the deployment artifacts. It is not given a name. In these cases, CloudFormation will automatically assign a unique name for it based on the name of the current stack â€” `$stackName`.

For all the other resources we define in our `serverless.yml`, we are responsible for parameterizing them.

Here are a couple examples of where we need to be aware of resource names being parameterized.

### SNS topic names in function events

``` yml
...
custom:
  stage: ${opt:stage, self:provider.stage}

...
functions:
  dispatcher:
    handler: handler.main
    events:
      - sns: dispatch-${self:custom.stage}
```

### DynamoDB table names in resources

``` yml
...
custom:
  stage: ${opt:stage, self:provider.stage}

...
resources:
  Resources:
    AppsTable:
      Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table
      Properties:
        TableName: objects-${self:custom.stage}
        AttributeDefinitions:
          - AttributeName: objectId
            AttributeType: S
        KeySchema:
          - AttributeName: appId
            KeyType: HASH
        BillingMode: 'PAY_PER_REQUEST'
```

### S3 bucket names in resources

Since, S3 bucket names need to be globally unique; leave the bucket name empty and let CloudFormation auto generate it.

``` yml
...
resources:
  Resources:
    MyBucket:
      Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
```

Parameterizing your resources allows your app to be deployed to multiple environments without naming conflicts.
