# Organizing Services

Monorepo (monolithic repository) means you have a single repository to store the code for many projects. Creating a new project is very easy, you just add create a new directory in the repo and add the code in there. It is been famously adopted by Google and Facebook. On the other hand, multi-repo means you create a repository for each project.

What does this mean in the Serverless/Micro-Service world? Imaging you are making a shopping cart and your app has 2 API services, each has their well defined business logic:

- **carts-api** service handling adding to and removing from shopping cart
- **checkout-api** service handling making a purchase

And your app also 2 jobs:

- **confirmation-job** service handling sending user confirmation emails after successfully making a purchase
- **reset-cart-job** service handling resetting a shopping cart after a purchase is made

And also:

- **dynamodb** service defining a DynamoDB table `carts` used to store shopping cart data
- **s3** service defining a S3 bucket used to store transaction receipts

In the Multi-repo setup, you are likely to have 6 repositories, one for each service. 

In the Monorepo setup, you have one repository with all 6 repositories.

It is not the goal of this post to evaluate which setup is better. Instead, I want to layout what we think is a good setup and that has worked out for most teams. We are taking the middle ground and creating two repositories, **my-cart-resources** and **my-cart-app**.

In **my-cart-resources**, you have:
```
    /
      services/
        dynamodb/
        s3/
```
And in **my-cart-app**, you have
```
    /
      libs/
      services/
        carts-api/
        checkout-api/
    		confirmation-job/
    		reset-cart-job/
```
Why? Mostly of the code changes are going to happen in the **my-cart-app** repo. When your team is making rapid changes, you are likely going to have many feature branches, bug fixes and pull requests. A bonus with serverless is that you can spin up new environment at zero cost (You only pay for usage, not provisioning). For example, a team can have dozens of stages such as: prod, staging, dev, feature-x, feature-y, feature-z, bugfix-x, bugfix-y, pr-128, pr-132, etc. This ensures each change is tested on real infrastructure before promoted to production.

On the other hand, changes are going to happen less frequently in the **my-cart-resources** app. And most likely you don't need a completely set of standalone Dynamodb tables for each feature branch. In fact, a team can have three stages such as: prod, staging and dev. And the feature/bugfix/pr stages of the **my-cart-app** can all connect to the dev stag of the **my-cart-resources.**

In fact, this is what we have been seeing teams tend to do. And this setup scales well.

Now we have decided to place all of our API services inside the same repo **my-cart-app**, now let's take a look at how to organize the code inside it.
