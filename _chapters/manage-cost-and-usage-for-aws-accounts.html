When organized under AWS Organizations, you donâ€™t have to setup the billing details for each account. Billing is consolidated to the root account. You can also see a breakdown of usage and cost for each service in each account.

# Free Tier

Each account in your AWS Organization benefits from the free tier. Lambda has a free tier that a 1GB Memory Lambda function can execute for 400,000 seconds per month. That is 400,000 seconds for each of your `Development`, `Staging` and `Production` account. If the usage is low in your `Development` and `Staging` accounts, it is likely you are not paying for them.

# Cost/Usage Breakdown by Account

Go into your root account. Select the account picker at the top. Then select **My Billing Dashboard**.

The Billing Dashboard home page shows you the cost to date of the current calendar month. A few very useful features on this page:

- **Cost Explorer**: see cost break down by day/week/month; by account; by resource tag; by service; etc.
- **Budgets**: set alert based by usage limit and cost limit.

For the purpose of this chapter, select **Bill Details**.
